# Lake Pajamas Premium Sleepwear: Ultra-Soft Pima Cotton, Luxury Comfort, Free Shipping Over $75

Look, I'm not someone who typically gets excited about pajamas. For years, I slept in whatever t-shirt was clean and some old sweatpants. But then someone introduced me to Lake Pajamas, and honestly? It changed everything about how I think about sleep.

Here's what happened: I was scrolling through Instagram one night (as one does at 11 PM), and kept seeing these striped pajamas pop up everywhere. Not in an annoying ad way, but in that "real people actually wear these" way. Friends were posting about them. Lifestyle bloggers I follow were genuinely raving. Even my cousin mentioned them at Thanksgiving.

So naturally, I got curious.

## What Makes Lake Pajamas Different?

Founded in 2014 by two friends in Savannah, Georgia, Lake Pajamas started because Cassandra Cannon and Anne Read Lattimore couldn't find what they were looking for: classic, comfortable pajamas that didn't look like something your grandmother would wear. They decided to make them themselves.

The thing that sets Lake apart is their commitment to premium materials. Most of their pajamas use 100% Peruvian Pima Cotton, which is basically the cashmere of cotton. It's softer than regular cotton, more durable, and has this silky feel that somehow gets better with every wash.

They're not trying to reinvent pajamas or make them "smart" with weird tech features. They're just making really, really good ones. Classic styles in beautiful patterns and colors that actually make you want to change into your pajamas after dinner.

## The Fabric Game: What You're Actually Getting

Lake offers several fabric options, and understanding them helps you pick what works for your sleep style:

**Pima Cotton** – This is their signature. 100% Peruvian Pima Cotton that's breathable, cooling, and impossibly soft. It's thick enough to feel substantial but light enough to keep you comfortable. Great for all seasons.

**DreamModal™** – A silky-smooth blend that's 95% modal and 5% spandex. This one has a bit of stretch and drapes beautifully. If you like that buttery-soft feeling, this is your fabric.

**Pointelle** – A delicate knit with decorative holes that add texture and breathability. Perfect for warmer months or if you run hot at night.

**Seersucker** – Lightweight, textured cotton that's perfect for summer. It has that classic preppy vibe and keeps you cool.

**French Terry Modal** – A cozy, slightly heavier option that's perfect for lounging around on weekends.

## My Personal Experience (The Good and The Real)

I started with the Pima Short-Long Set in Hydrangea – that's the purple-blue color everyone seems to love. When the package arrived, the presentation alone made me feel like I'd ordered something special. They come in this beautiful box that you could honestly give as a gift without any extra wrapping.

First impression when I put them on? These are soft. Like, unexpectedly soft. The fabric has weight to it but doesn't feel heavy. The fit was relaxed but not sloppy. And the piping detail actually makes them look put-together, not like you just rolled out of bed.

Here's what I noticed after a few months of wearing them:

**The softness is real** – And it actually does get better with washing. I was skeptical about this claim, but it's true. After 5-6 washes, they're even softer.

**They do shrink** – This is important. Lake warns you about this, and they're not kidding. These are 100% cotton, so they'll shrink, mostly in length. If you're between sizes, size up. I learned this the hard way.

**The quality lasts** – I've had mine for over a year now, and they still look great. No pilling, no fading, no weird stretching. They wash well and maintain their shape.

**You'll want to wear them all the time** – This sounds dramatic, but I find myself changing into my Lake pajamas right after dinner. They're that comfortable.

## Real Customer Experiences

I dug into what actual customers are saying, and here's the honest truth:

The reviews are overwhelmingly positive, with many people calling them "the best pajamas ever." People genuinely love the softness, the quality, and how they hold up over time. One reviewer said she does laundry just so she can wash and wear them again – which honestly tracks with my experience.

However, there are some consistent concerns worth noting:

**Shrinkage is a real issue** – Multiple customers report significant shrinking after the first wash, even when following care instructions carefully. While Lake warns about shrinkage, some people find it more extreme than expected.

**Customer service has mixed reviews** – Some people have great experiences, while others report frustration with inflexibility around returns and exchanges, especially for washed items.

**Sizing can be tricky** – Because of the shrinkage factor and the generous sizing, getting the right fit takes some guesswork. Many recommend sizing up, but then the pre-shrunk fit might feel too big.

The bottom line? These are genuinely great pajamas with some real considerations around sizing and care. They're not perfect for everyone, but when they work, people become superfans.

## How to Get the Best Deal

Lake doesn't run constant sales or offer discount codes everywhere. They typically have three main sales each year:

- **Annual Sale** (usually January)
- **Summer Sale** (July)
- **Black Friday/Cyber Monday Sale**

Based on coupon site data from early 2026, you can sometimes find codes for 10-25% off, though they're not always widely available. The most commonly mentioned working codes include newsletter signup discounts (typically 10% off first purchase).

For the best savings: 👉 [Sign up for their newsletter](https://lakepajamas.com) to get notified about sales and possibly snag a first-time buyer discount.

## The Maternity & Family Collections

One thing Lake does really well is maternity pajamas. They have dedicated maternity styles with empire waists and extra room for growing bellies, plus nursing-friendly options for postpartum.

**Maternity Pricing:**
- Maternity Shorts Sets: $108
- Maternity Long-Long Sets: $138
- Maternity Nightgowns: $94-$108

They also have extensive collections for kids and babies, so you can do the whole matching family thing if that's your vibe. (No judgment either way.)

## Sizing Guide: What Actually Fits

Here's what I've learned about sizing from my own experience and reading dozens of reviews:

**For Pima Cotton styles:** These run true to size BUT will shrink. If you're between sizes, definitely go up. The shrinkage happens mostly in length, so your pants might go from floor-length to ankle-length.

**For DreamModal™ styles:** These have stretch and tend to fit more snugly. They're designed to hug your body a bit more. Size up if you want a looser fit.

**For Crew styles:** These have a slimmer, more tailored fit compared to the classic styles.

Real talk from a 5'2" perspective: If you're short like me, the shrinkage in length is actually a blessing. These pants are designed to be long, so after washing, they hit at a perfect ankle length rather than dragging on the floor.

## Care Instructions (Actually Important)

This is where people mess up, so pay attention:

- **Wash on cold, delicate cycle** with like colors
- **No bleach or OxyClean** (this will mess up the fabric)
- **Hang dry or lay flat** – DO NOT machine dry
- Wash separately from heavy items like jeans and towels

The hand-dry thing might seem annoying, but it's actually what keeps these pajamas looking new for years. I hang mine on a drying rack, and they're usually dry within a few hours.

## Who Should Actually Buy Lake Pajamas?

After living with these for a while, here's my honest take on who these are for:

**You'll love them if:**
- You value quality over quantity
- You're willing to invest in things you use every day
- You appreciate natural, breathable fabrics
- You like classic, timeless styles
- You're okay with hand-drying your pajamas

**Maybe skip if:**
- You want low-maintenance, toss-in-the-dryer pajamas
- You're very particular about sizing and hate returns
- You prefer stretchy, forgiving fabrics
- You like trendy patterns that change every season

## The Bottom Line

Are Lake Pajamas worth $100+? Here's my take: if you wear pajamas every single night (which you probably do), and these last you 5+ years (which they will if you care for them properly), you're paying about $20 per year for really excellent sleepwear.

Compare that to buying $30 pajamas from a random store that pill after six months and lose their shape after a year. You'll end up spending more replacing cheap pajamas over five years than you would buying one quality Lake set.

Plus – and this is going to sound silly but it's true – there's something about putting on really nice pajamas that makes your whole evening feel better. It's a small luxury that you experience every single day.

The shrinkage thing is annoying and real, so factor that into your sizing decision. And know that if something goes wrong, customer service might not wow you with flexibility. But if you get the right size and care for them properly, these are exceptional pajamas.

## Ready to Upgrade Your Sleep Game?

If you've read this far, you're probably already convinced (or at least curious enough to try them). My advice: start with one set in a classic style and color. See how you like them. If they work for you, you'll probably end up wanting more. That's what happened to me, anyway.

👉 [Shop the full Lake Pajamas collection](https://lakepajamas.com) and see what catches your eye. Remember, they offer free shipping on orders over $75, so your first set ships free.
